# **Smart Parking Garage System**

## **Overview**

The Smart Parking Garage System was designed to streamline parking operations through automation, integrating real-world sensors and digital interfaces to create a user-friendly parking experience. Though this project was ultimately discontinued, it showcases expertise in full-stack development, IoT integration, and user-centered design.

## **Features**

### **1. Seamless Entry and Registration**

- Users receive a unique QR code upon registering at the entrance, simulating a real-world parking ticket machine.
- QR codes are scanned at the gate to allow access, leveraging modern technologies to ensure a smooth entry process.

### **2. Dynamic Slot Management**

- Real-time slot availability is displayed using sensor data.
- Visual indicators (e.g., red and green lights) guide drivers to open spaces, optimizing the use of available parking.

### **3. Automated Billing**

- A free first hour of parking is offered, followed by an hourly charge of $6.
- Upon exit, users input their unique ID to calculate and process payment automatically.

### **4. Admin Controls**

- Admins can monitor and manage available slots.
- Manual override options allow for quick adjustments to check-ins and check-outs.

## **Technologies Used**

- **Frontend:** React for creating an intuitive user interface.
- **Backend:** Node.js for handling logic such as unique ID generation, QR code creation, time tracking, and billing.
- **Hardware Simulation:** Simulated sensors for slot detection and availability indicators.

## **Key Achievements**

- Designed and implemented a full-stack parking system that bridges physical and digital operations.
- Demonstrated expertise in integrating IoT concepts with web applications, showcasing practical problem-solving.
- Focused on user experience, optimizing the parking process for both customers and administrators.
